                <p>In week 1 we formed our group “The 3 Amigos” with myself, Ben and Charles. Coming from very different backgrounds and not knowing each other at all, we spent some time on completing the Group Charter document and learning more about our strengths and weaknesses. We set the following as some of our main goals:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Communicate clearly and respectfully</li>
                  <li>Respect ideas as presented</li>
                  <li>Follow up decisions by verifying ideas and visual concepts</li>

                <p>We then moved on to the design brief and did some research on autonomous vehicles to learn more about the field and existing concepts. We decided to continue our research at home and come back to studio next week with at least 10 concepts each. 
                During the week I became more familiar with the idea of driverless cars and how this technology can be useful to help people. I came up with the following initial concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Drones for controlling traffic when traffic lights are broken.</li>
                  <li>Drones for cleaning high rise buildings windows.</li>
                  <li>Drones for installing posters on highways or streets.</li>
                  <li>Traffic controller drones at construction sights.</li>
                  <li>Drones to assist children or the blind to cross the road.</li>
                  <li>Autonomous vehicle to drive kids to/from school or from activity to activity.</li>

                <p>During the studio we brought together all our initial ideas and came up with 31 in total. After discussing design problems around each we narrowed them down to 6. By voting for our favourites we ended up with 4 “Top Ideas”:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Autonomous vehicle to drive kids to/from school or from activity to activity</li>
                  <li>Food and beverage drive around delivery drone</li>
                  <li>Drone to be first response to 000 calls</li>
                  <li>Agriculture data provision service model</li>

                <p>To make a final decision, we wrote 5 questions for our top 2 ideas. By answering them we realised we were gravitating more towards the idea of an autonomous vehicle that independently transports children to school and extracurricular activities. Having established our problem space, our next step was to identify the key stakeholders for which we developed a stakeholder map. This process helped us to identify our project’s target audience that we were planning to conduct research on. </p>

                <p>After that we prepared a list of 5 research questions that were going to lead our individual research processes. We allocated specific research methods to each question that we thought were suitable to gather insights.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>What are the hardest challenges of getting kids from A to B?  (Interview, contextual observation)</li>
                  <li>What kind and level of supervision is needed for different age groups?  (Interview, survey)
                  </li>
                  <li>What information does the requester provide?  (Interview, contextual inquiry)</li>
                  <li>What makes a ride enjoyable for kids?  (Interview, contextual inquiry)</li>
                  <li>What works well for current ride sharing users?  (Interview, survey, desktop research)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We set our <b>research goal</b> as bellow:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>To investigate how families transport children to school and extra-curricular activities.
                  </li>
                  <li>To identify difficulties involved in current processes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We agreed that a questionnaire can be a great starting point for gathering some general knowledge about the existing transportation methods and problems with them. Based on our 5 research questions, we used Google Forms to prepare a 12 items questionnaire. We then sent it out to a wide range of participants within our target audience via social media platforms.</p>

Since most were busy school parents, it turned out to be more difficult than expected. Finding a timeframe and a place that suited the participants was almost impossible. I decided to accomodate their daily schedules by visiting them at their homes or places of business.</p>

Contextual observation is a very useful research method as the user is performing his/her normal tasks without having to think about them and the researcher is recording all that happens at the moment of interaction.</p>

                <p>My 4th interview was with Ara Galstian, a parent of 3 primary school children who spent about 15 hours weekly to drive his children around. I visited them at their family home and with his consent I recorded the interview on my phone. Ara’s thoughts about using autonomous vehicles for children transportation were quite positive and interesting. In his opinion it is quite pressuring for full time working parents to accomodate the busy schedules of their kids. Sometimes kids miss out on activities as parents can't get them to all those destinations in time. He thought having the option of an autonomous service to use at times of need will be quite useful. One of his suggestions for the future design was to consider a live camera to communicate with kids during the ride in order to create peace of mind for parents.</p>

              <p>Week 4 was about analysing and synthesising all gathered data through interviews, survey, contextual observations and contextual interviews. I prepared a 24 page transcription of the interviews and carefully went through all data. I then gathered all statements into groups according to research questions. After that I broke down each group into more specific themes and continued grouping statements under each. Finally I ended up with 23 themes that were ready to be put up on the wall to make the affinity diagram. After grouping statement under corresponding sticky notes I recorded some possible design solutions for future development on top layer green notes. This was a very long process that continued during the next couple of days and together with analysed survey data resulted to the key findings.</p>

              <p>Based on the insights and key findings generated from the research, I developed two personas. First one was Belinda, a busy mum with 2 children who was frustrated at having to spend too much time driving kids around. Her goal was to have reliable children’s transport system with certified monitors. My second persona was Paige, an eight year old student. Her frustration was getting tired, hungry and bored during long bus/car trips and her motivations were transport convenience and socialising with friends. The two personas were created on the basis of all the insights derived from research and were representing my average participants.</p>

              <p>Stephanie Grace in this week’s lecture and tutorial explained effective ways for communicating design ideas and discussed wireframing techniques in more depth. During the tutorial we looked at a scenario for an autonomous vehicle with an incident on the route which was quite relevant to our project. We started considering emergency cases such as an accident on the way of the vehicle or an unwell child in passenger seat. How would the vehicle effectively communicate these cases to the requester and continue after a decision was received? How would the passenger child be notified of the change?</p>

              <p>We spent a significant time of the studio discussing all our research findings. We gathered them all in a document and started brainstorming with the most common themes. It was interesting to see some of our results were very similar even though we conducted research with different  participants and by different methods. After long discussions with our tutor we agreed that even though the problem exists across all families with school children, those with smaller kids have the largest need for an independent transportation service. So we narrowed our target audience to primary school parents only and we set down two focused design concepts for further development.</p>

                <p>Still in the early phase of our project, this week we were shown how to make low fidelity paper prototypes and how to evaluate them with our users. As an exercise we wrote down the scenario of ordering for an autonomous vehicle through our app. We made the following design considerations:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Where is pick up, where is destination</li>
                  <li>Timeframe</li>
                  <li>Ride customisation</li>
                  <li>Confirm child’s identity</li>
                  <li>View the ride (vehicle’s location)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We then wrote the user story and each started sketching interface solutions. After that we moved onto making the prototype by using a phone frame and some tracing paper. We evaluated the prototype by testing it with our classmates and recorded the results.</p>

                <p>This exercise made it quite clear for us that in order to move further with our paper prototypes we needed to determine all the tasks that the user is able to perform through our app. In doing so we discussed our two main deign ideas and decided to go ahead with only one. The idea of a shared autonomous school bus was eliminated as we found it to be too simple for the UI design and too impractical as a service.</p>
                <p>We then recorded the following two ideas as the ones we wanted to take further.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Idea 1:  an autonomous ride service for children transportation from the requester’s (parent’s) point of view</li>

After that each group member chose two main tasks from both mindmaps to take home and sketch interface solutions for.</p>

              <p>Both Uber and GoCatch allow different ride options that the user can chose from. Uber facilitates scheduling a trip by including the option on the very first page. With both inputting pick up and destination addresses were quite seamless. GoCatch had a more complex interface for scheduling than Uber. Taking all these solutions on board I started putting my ideas on paper.  </p>

                <p>Along with working on iterations, we also started outsourcing participants for our evaluation sessions. We decided to test with 6 parents for the requester app and 6 primary school children for the passenger app. Since I already knew a lot of primary school families from my dance community, I decided to reach out and ask parents for participation. I also got in touch with the AGBU Alexander Primary School where I had conducted my initial research and asked for the principal’s permission to run one of the sessions at the school.</p>

Given the large scale of the assessment and the limited time we decided to set a timeline to follow in the next 3 weeks to get all necessary tasks done. We also prepared a testing statement for our participants to facilitate the evaluation sessions.</p> 
              <p>On Monday the 24th we met again to go through our second iterations, to finalise and transfer them across to POP for testing. Charles took the responsibility of arranging the sketches in POP while I set with parents and children for our first session. </p>

                <p>We ran our 1st evaluation session on the 25th at The Armenian Cultural Centre with 3 parents and 2 children. We had the requester app on a mobile phone for parents and the passenger app on a tablet for children. I set up one of the rooms and asked the children to go first. Charles ran them through the app while I recorded the session and took some notes. The overall flow was smooth and the results were interesting specially when some parents shared their personal opinions on improving the service. I learnt that it was important for the facilitator to exactly know all screens and the flow between them in order to avoid confusion for participants. </p>

This time we had 3 adult participants and 4 primary school children. The whole session was video recorded on my phone for future analysing. Some comments from children were quite common between them which was telling us there were need for adjustments in specific areas. For example most of them thought the trip progress bar was a battery indicator.</p> 
                  <p>It was also interesting to learn that some parents were quite against the idea of an autonomous vehicle transporting their children without an adult supervision.

                <br><p>We decided to base our refined idea from Idea 1, because Idea 2 didn’t have as much depth. Through our evaluation, we found the app’s affordance required it to be incredibly simple, and without a lot of features. Therefore after consultation with our tutor we assessed it to be not complex enough for this stage of Task 2.</p>
                <p>Moving forward with the refined idea, we specified designs from Idea 1 that needed revision and discussed ways to improve them so that they would directly address user needs expressed during evaluations. The map interface was almost universally understood and liked, so we included this in the refined idea. We also kept the general flow of screens, however, cleaned up their interactions to create a better user experience. It was necessary to consider how to convey different types of passengers, and ensure that price was displayed to help inform the requesters’ decisions.</p>

              <p>Moving onto Sketch for wireframing, we worked towards adding more details to each screen, increasing the fidelity slightly, and producing a more realistic prototype. We split the screens between myself and Ben and each did separate iterations. Following the advice of our tutor we used minimal colour and font in order to stay true to the low fidelity nature of these first wireframes. This was also useful for focusing on the functionality and flow of the screens.</p>

              <p>During week 9 we put all forces together towards finalising the evaluation process, planning and generating the final report. All of our class time was dedicated to finalising the two Sketch designs me and Ben did, cleaning them up and unifying elements which were different. This was a time consuming and detailed process but with our collaboration and professional approach we were able to accomplish it within the short timeframe. I was then tasked with adding final touches at home and transferring the whole wireframe across to InVision and make the interactive low fidelity prototype. I did a pilot test of InVision with my husband to make sure it all works well before taking it out to testing sessions.</p>

              <p>The next step was to evaluate the updated InVision prototype. This time we decided to test with 6 participants over a couple of days and at five different locations. My participants were Tony my brother in law, Mary one of my dance parents and Jacques my husband. I ran one of the sessions at The Armenian Cultural Centre and the other two at our home. All tests were performed using InVision on my phone and were video recorded for future evaluation.</p>
              <p>These tests gave us strong insights into problem areas with the UI. These related to suggested data display features, questions about feature details, and the quoting of price display. 
              When all testing was completed each of us went through the data individually and recorded the feedback received from participants. After that we met to go through all evaluation results and made an itemised list of all problem areas we wanted to address.</p>

                <p>This week we submitted our Evaluation Report and presented it in front of the group. Then we discussed our tasks for the next assessment: Interactive Prototype. The first requirement was designing high fidelity mockups on the basis of our low fidelity prototype. This would then be developed into an interactive prototype using InVision. The final requirement was creating a narrated video walkthrough of the prototype demonstrating all the features of it.</p>
                <p>I took the task of working on first iteration of the high fidelity mockup. My first step was to look at all low fidelity wireframes that myself and Ben had developed and to unify all finer design elements.</p>

They set down a scenario where Charles would perform all 4 tasks on the app and screen record them. Then they recorded Ben’s voice to go over Charles’s screen recording. After receiving all video and voice recordings I started the video production in Adobe After Effects. This was an easy but detailed and time consuming process but the result was promising.</p>
